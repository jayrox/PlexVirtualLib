# PlexVirtualLib

Create Plex Virtual Libraries by adding "VL-" tags to Plex movie's sharing dialog.  

You will need to manually edit the `VirtualLib.txt` file to update the path to your `com.plexapp.plugins.library.db` file.  
On Windows this can typically be found here: 
`C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Local\Plex Media Server\Plug-in Support\Databases\com.plexapp.plugins.library.db`  
You will also need to create a `VirtualLib` folder and update the path in the `VirtualLib.txt` file.

Requires SQLite:
